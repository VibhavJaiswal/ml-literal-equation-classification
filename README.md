Literal Equation Classifier

A machine learning-based classifier to identify literal equations using TF-IDF vectorization and a Random Forest model. The project includes training, testing, and deploying the model via a Flask API.
ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ… Preprocesses equations using TF-IDF
âœ… Trains multiple ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc.)
âœ… Evaluates models and selects the best one based on F1-score
âœ… Deploys the model using Flask for API-based predictions

ðŸ“Œ Training the Model

If you want to train the model from scratch:

    Open literal_equation_classifier.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
    Run all the cells to:
        Load and preprocess data.
        Train multiple machine learning models.
        Save the best-performing model (random_forest_best_model.pkl).
        Save the TF-IDF vectorizer (tfidf_vectorizer.pkl).

ðŸ“Œ Running the Flask API

    Ensure the saved model and vectorizer are in the project folder.
    Run the Flask server:

python app.py

ðŸ“Œ Testing the API

You can test the API using Postman or cURL.
âœ… Using Postman

    Open Postman.
    Set Method to POST.
    Enter URL
    Go to the Body tab â†’ Select raw â†’ Choose JSON.
    Send the following JSON request:

{
    "features": ["F = ma", "2 + 3 = 5", "P = IV", "E = mc^2"]
}

Click Send and check the response.

ðŸ“Œ Model Details

    Vectorization: TF-IDF (max_features=50000)
    Best Model: Random Forest (n_estimators=30, random_state=42)
    Dataset: Preprocessed CSV of equations
